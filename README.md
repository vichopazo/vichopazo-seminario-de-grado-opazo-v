# The evolution of environmental issues in Chilean foreign policy discourse since the return to democracy. Applying Structural Topic Modelling to the UN General Debate interventions by Chilean officials from 1990 to 2022

Topic modelling analysis of all General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly speeches by Chilean representatives/heads of state from 1990 to 2022. This repository contains a newly created corpus available for public use, namely the "UNGDC Chile (1971-2022)" ([click here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vicente_Opazo/publication/363844089_UN_General_Debate_Corpus_Chile_1971-2022/data/637ff22148124c2bc6674ae8/UNGDC-Chile-1971-2022.zip) to download, or check the Rproject code), plus the corresponding subset "UNGDC Chile (1990-2022)".  


# Relevant methodological considerations
 
For the purpose of our research, we created a new corpus (i.e., set of texts), namely the United Nations General Debate corpus Chile. It consists of all the 52 interventions by Chilean officials/representatives at the UNGD from 1971 to 2022. Furthermore, we created an ad hoc subset to analyse the speeches since the return to democracy: the UNGD Chile (1990-2022), consisting of 33 documents. We also created both corpora’s metadata . The UNGD corpus Chile is a narrowed version of the “United Nations General Debate Corpus” (Mikhaylov, J.S., Baturo, A., and Dasandi, N. 2017), plus the most recent interventions by President Sebastián Piñera (2021) and President Gabriel Boric (2022). 

The Spanish version of the 2021 speech delivered by President Piñera was retrieved from the official site of the Presidential Press Office  and then translated to English via automatic translation tools (we then proceeded to review it to check for grammar mistakes), while the official English version of the 2022 intervention by President Boric was available in his government’s site .  

UNGD corpus Chile documents are in .txt format and labelled according to a) the ISO 3166-alpha 3 code of Chile, b) the session of United Nations General Assembly in which the speech was delivered, and c) the corresponding year (e.g., CHL_26_1971). The texts were labelled in such way in order to follow the UNGC logic, thus making data manipulation -e.g., integration to other corpora- easier, keeping a standardised format. The following metadata is available for our main corpus and the 1990-2022 subset: 

•	the year of delivery of the speech
•	the number of the UN General Debate session
•	the country of the speaker
•	the speaker’s full name
•	the speaker’s post
•	additional notes 
•	the “government rating” of the corresponding government in office.
